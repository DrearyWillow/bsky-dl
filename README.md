# bsky-dl
Works with both python and bash.

`bsky-dl [post-url] [download-directory]`

Download the bsky-dl file and edit the 'defaults' dictionary. cd to the install directory and run `python bsky-dl` or `./bsky-dl`.

Or put the file in `~/.local/bin` (or anywhere else in your $PATH) and run `bsky-dl`.

This is probably a terrible implementation but it was fun to throw together.
