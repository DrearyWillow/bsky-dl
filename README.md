# bsky-dl
Works with both python and bash.

`bsky-dl [post_url] [download_path]`

Download the bsky-dl file and run `python bsky-dl` or `./bsky-dl`. Or put the file in `~/.local/bin` (or anywhere else in your $PATH) and run `bsky-dl`.

This is a terrible implementation but it was fun to throw together. Also you need ffmpeg.
